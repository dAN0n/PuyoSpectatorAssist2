# PuyoSpectatorAssist2
An updated version of the SpectatorAssist2. Tkinter is used to create the overlay so it should be more accurate with real-time information.

# To Do
* Create GUI tool for choosing your screen region.
* Currently, the tool checks for chains every 2 frames, so it gets visually annoying. Make the tool only check for chains after each piece placement.
* Package the tool somehow so people don't need their own Python installations? What do people use for this?
